## Description

This is my bleeding edge version of Google Go's HTTP package. 
Things here are eventually submitted to the main Google Go library.

This project also contains my research in designing new components
for Go's HTTP infrastructure, like smart server classes, RESTful
API servers, etc.

The the packages in this project are used "in production" on a few
sites that I run, like e.g. [Population algorithms](http://popalg.org).

## Installation

To install, simply run

	goinstall github.com/petar/GoHTTP/http
